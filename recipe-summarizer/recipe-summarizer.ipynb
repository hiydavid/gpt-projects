       "\"This is the BEST Seafood Boil recipe you can whip up right at home, y’all. It’s loaded with jumbo shrimp, crab, andouille sausage, potatoes, eggs, and corn on the cob that’s simmered in a flavor-filled broth of cajun spices and aromatics. All that hearty goodness gets drowned and smothered in an epic garlic butter sauce. This finger-licking-good seafood boil recipe is an easy meal that serves a crowd! Mmmhmmm, seafood boils just cannot be beat, especially during these summer months. The delicious mess of seafood, sausage, potatoes, and corn all drenched in sauce and dripping from your fingertips…whew. The entire experience is so much fun and so dang good huh. Buckle up and let’s get into this recipe! This easy to make boil is brimming with all the meaty, hearty bites like andouille, shrimp, and crab. And then there’s filling elements like potatoes, corn, and hard-boiled eggs to amp up the fullness of it all. In my honest opinion, a seafood boil is questionable if it doesn’t include big flavor and spices- just keeping it real. You’ll love the heaps of flavor from Cajun seasoning and Old Bay spices all throughout: in the boil itself and in the luscious garlic butter sauce, swoon. ⇢ Whether it’s this miso shrimp scampi, my mahi mahi w/ butter sauce, or this dreamy, soul-hugging Cajun gumbo, I just love me some seafood dishes! ⇢ First, let’s discuss some main highlights that you’ll appreciate here: (Note: the full ingredients list, including measurements, is provided in the recipe card directly below.) Excellent question, let’s talk about. The key to a really phenomenal seafood boil is to make the liquid as flavorful as possible, friends. Without that deep penetrating flavor the ingredients will be bland and sad, oof. Beer is one of the elements that adds a little razzle dazzle to enhance the boil broth. In addition to the beer, plenty of spices and aromatics make the liquid sing in flavorful notes. However, if beer is not your thing, you can surely proceed without it, too. ⇢ I recommend using lagers, IPAs, or pilsners for choices of beer! 👍🏾 (Note: please see the recipe card directly below for the complete written instructions.) Here’s some extra tidbits & more information about this seafood boil recipe: The types of seafood called for in this recipe will guide you on a really good seafood boil session, but you can also deviate and customize it to your liking! My Cajun seafood boil calls for snow crab clusters and shrimp- more options such as mussels, clams, other crab varieties (king crab legs, Dungeness crab, etc.), crawfish, and lobster tails all work well in seafood boils. Just use about 2 – 2 ½ pounds of your favorite seafood in the boil (make sure the crab you select is pre-cooked!). You can use frozen seafood just fine in this recipe, too. ⇢ It’s important to note that not all seafood cooks at the same rate, let’s look into some cooking time frames for specific seafood: Seafood boils are traditionally served by emptying the ingredients onto a newspaper-lined table. Pour the buttery sauce over the goods and then everyone just goes after whatever they desire. It’s quite chaotic and fun in the very best way! Additionally, it makes the clean-up much easier. However, I like to serve it on an extra large baking sheet or platter. Everything is more contained and the garlic butter sauce doesn’t soak into the newspaper. Summer is here and this Cajun Seafood Boil needs to be enjoyed by you and all of your peeps, everyone’s gonna love! Be sure to tag @butterbeready in your BBR recipe creations, I sure love to see it when you do. Until next time! 🤟🏾 This is the BEST Seafood Boil recipe you can whip up right at home, y’all.

Hi Julie- Sure thing, you can def add more seafood to the boil, just be sure that you use a big enough cooking vessel to accommodate the add-ins.

Any suggestions on keeping the flavor but reducing the heat?\\xa0 Hey Jessica- Feel free to omit the hot sauce, use Cajun seasoning to preference, and sub andouille for kielbasa/beef sausage perhaps.

In an extra large stockpot or dutch oven over medium-high heat, combine the water and beer (if using). Bring the liquid to a boil. Then season the boil with the Cajun seasoning, Old Bay seasoning, and a few dashes of hot sauce- to taste. Add the sliced onion and lemon wedges into the pot. Stir all the ingredients well to thoroughly combine. Let the mixture boil for 15 minutes.\\nAdd the andouille & potatoes. Carefully add the andouille sausage rounds and baby potatoes into the pot, stirring well to fully combine with the boil. Let the andouille and potatoes cook for 15-20 minutes- or until the potatoes are just about fork-tender.\\nAdd the seafood & corn. Gently nestle the snow crab clusters into the pot along with the shrimp and corn on the cob. Be sure that everything is fully submerged under the boil and carefully stir to ensure all ingredients are well combined. Continue boiling for another 5-7 minutes, cooking until the shrimp is pink. Meanwhile, prepare the garlic butter sauce.\\nMake the garlic butter sauce. On a separate burner, in a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the butter, garlic, lemon juice, Old Bay seasoning, parsley, Cajun seasoning, smoked paprika, and hot sauce- to taste. Stir all ingredients and simmer the sauce until the butter melts and the sauce is well combined, stirring often, about 5-7 minutes. Then remove from heat.\\nAssemble cajun seafood boil with sauce. Line an extra large baking sheet with foil/parchment paper (or newspaper if you’d like!). Use a spider strainer to remove the seafood boil contents from the pot and place onto the prepared baking sheet along with the hard boiled eggs (if using)- remove and discard the onion/lemon bits. Note: If you’d like your garlic butter sauce to be thinner, you can add some of the seafood boil broth to adjust to desired consistency. Now, this is the fun part! Pour the garlic butter sauce over the seafood boil ingredients. Then use your hands (fitted with disposable gloves if desired) to toss the sauce with everything, smothering every nook and cranny in sauce.\\nServe seafood boil. Feel free to serve this Cajun seafood boil as-is with everyone just grabbing what they’d like from the baking sheet directly (it’s the chaos and messiness of seafood boils that are so fun!) or divide the boil onto individual plates to serve if you prefer. Serve immediately with lemon wedges, if desired. Be sure to sop up any runaway garlic butter sauce.
